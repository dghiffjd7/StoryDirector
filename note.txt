the main goal of this extension is to help user build story outlines that can help create fantastic stories, the extension right now includes places for user to input their needs, read lorebooks/Settings, and build prompts for writing outlines. Now we need to add functions for further experience, first is to find the logic about detailOutlines, the detailOutlines calls when the user are satisfied with the basic outlines, and want to have more detailed outlines. We need to build user friendly experience, now when we double click on the card of the main outline we generated, it can edit the block(card), and when our mouse move to certain block, buttons including copy,delete, and generate detail outlines will appear. We will desgin like this: When the user long press the block, or click on the generate detail outline button, this block will be focused(Can be designed like floating style) and make background vagueï¼Œwhen the block is focused, the user can edit the block or press generate detailed outlines. When generate detailed outlines, it will call the built prompts(another version that is for detailed outlines, user can manage different version of prompts inside the prompt manager part in our extension)and starts generating.While generating, this block we focused will keep floating(Or other style we designed), user can click outside the block and cancel focusing(but the generating process will continue) and do other actions, once the generating is over and we recieve the detailed outlines, this time will be related to the block(main outline) we focused, we can desgin this way: deatiled oueline does not show when we are on the extension main page, only when we click on the related block and enter focused mode, those related DBlocks will show, in a way that, surrounds the focused block and moves, like satellites surrounding the planet, and whne the mouse move to one of the satellites, this block stops moving and focus on this block(cancel focus if the mouse move outside this block), and when the user click this block, it will enter focuse mode as well, the user can edit,copy, delete this block just like what we can do to the main outline blocks.
